Gamework
========

Don't use this. It's terrible. But if you want to use it, it uses browserify for front-end includes. And I doubt you're going to find a compatible version of jquery-browserify unless you use mine, and I haven't added it to this project's package.json

Installation
------------

It's pretty easy to install. Clone the repository, and in the root directory..
```
zipp@zeratul:~/gamework$ npm install
zipp@zeratul:~/game$ npm start

> application-name@0.0.1 start /home/zipp/game
> node app

```

Browse to localhost:8080 and you should be up and running!
